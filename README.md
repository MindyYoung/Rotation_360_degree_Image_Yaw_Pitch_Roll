Rotation 360 degree video in yaw, pitch and roll
===================

# 1.Introduction
----------------

> 1. Input viedeo (.mp4), 
> 2. convert to images(.bmp)
> 3. Simulating user's head rotation at a certain angle in yaw, pitch and roll, I calculate the corresponding rotation matrix. Then The image is then rotated on the sphere and re-projected.
> 4. Rotated images are converted to video(.mp4) 
 


# 2.Enviroment
---------------
	- C++ vs2015+ OpenCV
		-- rotation.sln
